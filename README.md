- **Developed a real-time color detection system** using Python, OpenCV, and the PIL library to track specific colors in a live video feed.
- **Designed an algorithm** that converts BGR color values to HSV and dynamically determines upper and lower HSV limits, ensuring accurate color detection for varying lighting conditions.
- **Implemented object bounding box detection** by creating a binary mask and calculating bounding box coordinates, enabling real-time identification and tracking of color regions within a frame.
- **Integrated image processing techniques** with OpenCV, using methods such as color space conversion, mask generation, and rectangle drawing for visual feedback on detected objects.
- **Built modular code with a utility function** in `util.py` for flexibility, allowing easy adjustment and adaptability of color detection parameters.
- **Enhanced user control and interaction** with a responsive GUI that runs until the user manually exits, showcasing practical knowledge of OpenCVâ€™s image display and user event handling.
